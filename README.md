================

Ensure that the working directory is set to the directory where the data has been extracted.

Run the file run_analysis.R.

The output file cleaned_data.txt will be generated.

Decisions made during the project:
----------------------------------
1)  For mean and standard deviation mesuresments I only used the activity fields which had mean() and std() in the label.
2) In the final dataset I added the average for the std() and mean() fields for each subject and activity.
